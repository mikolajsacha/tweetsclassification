    "# Twitter classificator\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to test several Machine Learning classification methods in the context of textual data from Twitter. Being given a tweet, we want to be able to assign it to one of a few pre-defined categories. We will achieve this by using supervised Machine Learning techniques, so we will use a training set of a couple of hundreds of manually labeled tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Acquiring data\n",
    "\n",
    "First step is to acquire labeled tweets for training the model. At first, I tried searching on the Internet (I gathered three sample data sets, 'dataset1', '2' and '3'), but the data sets did not satisfy me, so I decided to gather and manually label Tweets myself.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "I defined six categories for tweets:<br>\n",
    "Music, Sport, Technology, Weather, Movies, Politics<br>\n",
    "I also created a seventh, \"Other\" category for tweets which don't fit in any of the former six.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "I used Twitter streaming API for getting all tweets in English from around the world. Then I filtered them using a set of keywords for each category (I tried to include as many keywords as possible, ~200 per category). In the end, I manually labeled those filtered tweets. This way I gathered dataset with circa 1500 Tweets (~200 per each category and ~300 labeled \"Other\")<br>\n",
    "I decided not to put the original script for acquiring data in the repository, as I don't think it is useful after getting the data set. However, there is a script for expanding the training set, of which I will tell more later.\n",

    "Now having a set of labeled sentences (I use the term 'sentence' interchangeably with 'tweet', although it is not strictly correct) we would want to train one of popular classification models, e. g. Neural Network or an SVM classifier. Alas, all these methods require our data to be numerical, not textual. To employ them in our problem we need to firstly get a Word Embedding to represent words from our dataset as vectors of numbers.<br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Having at least one word embedding is required for further work. They have sizes of a couple of GB each, so they can take some time to download.<br>\n",
    "You can also try other embeddings, but it is required that GloVe embeddings are in textual form (.txt) and word2vec in binary form (.bin).<br>\n",

    "We have aquired a Word Embedding which allows us to get a vector of numbers for each word. However, our training set consists of lists of words, so we need to specify how to represent a sentence (tweet) based on representations of its words. I test two different approaches:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "First is to simply concatanate word vectors, so for each sentence we get vector of size (number of words in sentence) * (size of a single word vector). To use machine learning algorithms each tweet vector must have the same size, so we need to specify a constant length of a sentence. For instance, we can decide that sentences longer than 30 words will be cut at the end and sentences shorter than 30 words will be filled with zeros.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Second approach is not to concatanate, but sum word vectors (element-wise). This means that the size of sentence vector will be the same as the size of word vector, so we don't have to artificially cut or lengthen tweets.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Concatanation yields longer vectors, so models will obviously need more time to compute. On the other hand, we don't lose information about order of words. However, if we look at this example we can see that in training for finding categories order of words may not be so important:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Tweet 1: \"President Obama was great!\"<br>\n",
    "Tweet 2: \"What a great president Obama was!\"<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Both are obviously about politics and we know this whatever order of words is.<br>\n",
    "Furthermore, if we have a small training set, we may encounter only one of these tweets. In sum embedding it is not a problem, because both will have very similar representation. In concatanation embedding we may end up with a model which labels correctly only one of them. So it is not obvious which embedding is going to work better.<br>"
