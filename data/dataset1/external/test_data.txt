And as we know i abhor tom cruise in general so i wouldn't buy into the bullshit anyway.
And because I love my Boston Terrier and feel that everyone else should too...

And personally, I like Hillary Clinton.
And proof that the inflight Southwest Airlines magazine is actually quite awesome:
And really, Allstate is a good company to work for, so I'd like that...
And stupid people at United Airlines make my brain hurt.
And stupid shanghai people, if you guys somehow manage to read this, COME BACK NOW!
And suddenly I begin to love San Francisco.
And the Dallas Mavericks were an excellent team.
And the Sony VAIO looks great enough to deserve a mention in my blog.
And the Super-cool ATA Elite Team!
And the dummies of the conspirators were burnt by the angry crowd in London and elsewhere in the country on bonfires.....
And the fact that the whole thing took place in San Francisco was even more awesome.
And the one we rented so we could see Paris Hilton die was lame.
And then, the team I wanted to win the NBA finals-the Dallas Mavericks-just lost game 6 of the finals to the Miami Heat, which means the Heat have won it all...
And then, when stupid Angelina Jolie had to show up with her cave woman lips to ruin it all by suggesting gellatinous oral sex!
And they thought my Paris Hilton Presentation was hilarious because they couldnt believe I did my Famous American presentation on Paris Hilton!!!!!!!!.

And though you have a nice car now, I'll always love the blue Toyota that didn't require a key to run.
And to hurt you even more, I love the Lakers...
And to my good friend, I think almost every Democrat would make a better president than the present but Hillary Clinton is a terrible choice.
And wants to kill Tom Cruise.....
And well, quite frankly I hate the Chicago Bulls.(
And with a somewhat shoddy defense this season, Seattle should be vulnerable in week seven...
And yea, so what if UCLA sucks, I'm still stuck there.
And yeah MIT is awesome...-the fact that my cousin goes there currently will not help me at all to get in.
And yeah, I love the new Volkswagen commercials..
And yes, we still need Harvard.
And you are a big fat meanie for telling a sick pregnant woman that UCLA sucks.
And your London Bridge song sucks AND blows-didn't know that was possible.
And, I don't care, Tom Cruise is a great Lestat!..
And, after the backing up is completed, I am going to make a Macbook Pro my final answer for my next fantastic computer purchase.
And, by the way, Seattle totally sucked in the Superbowl.
And, yes, UCLA is a good team and well coached ( Dorrell shoed CW a thing or two ), and deserved better...

I asked him if tom cruise was as handsome in real life as he was on film, he said " yes definatley, though he was much younger then.

I banged on the station window and shouted " HARVARD SUCKS!
I basically hate Tom Cruise and I thought the film was overrated.
I bet its a stupid hyundai sawduh ( see mine for mo'details.. ).

I did hate a few people at Hyundai but that ’ s to be expected.
I didn't even get to see the Lakers today, that was depressing in itself.
I didn't get EA at MIT which was very disappointing.
I didn't realize what was happening until I saw that the garage was the same, too, complete with my grandpa's beloved 1967 baby blue Volkswagen bug.

I dislike driving the Toyota 4-Runner because it's so bulky and heavy, and it wastes so much gas...

I don � t mean that I despise London � s Soho, but when the food isn � t very good, it should be called � So-so �.....

I don't think that the Pac-10 has the depth ( Stanford, Arizona, WSU, Oregon State and UCLA are all somewhere between terrible and inconsistent ).

If you don't mind the outlook, I will recommend IBM Thinkpad..
If you have a HONDA, State Farm Insurance is good because they work with Auto Repair shops that use actual Honda parts.

Is CanWest going to go home to Winnipeg and sob into its pillow, â   Those beautiful MIT students rejected me!
Is it wrong that I kinda want Hillary Clinton to run for President in 2008?..
It WAS a definite option for me to work to get into a school like Harvard.
It amuses me that you think Angelina Jolie is evil...
It appears, just from my lame research that American Airlines might be a bit on the paranoid over this.
It doesn't seem that you're looking for a small SUV, but I love my Toyota RAV4.
It doesn't take me like 3000 rpm to get to 10 mph in first gear like some crappy honda.
It is a 1996 Volkswagen Jetta that is in absolutly beautiful shape especially for a car that age, and I got it for very very cheap.
It is a bit like London in that respect I think...
It is almost like choosing something I do not know about, like allstate insurance denton texas, and then jumping into and going all the way with it.
It is football season again and UCLA sucks ass again.
It isn't over until its over though, and for now my brain is set on " I love Harvard, I want to come to Harvard " mode.....
It just reminded me of how rude London audiences can be.
It made me realize how much I miss London and all the people in it that have made my memories of that city so fond.
It really does feel like it's not politically correct to say this, but I love harvard.
It seems like you had somewhat of a " bonding " experience with God during allstate which is a truely amazing thing...
It seems that the CU agent, the one we had had so much trouble with in Shanghai ( the angry young Chinese man ) had failed to send the paper work to China Unicom!
It seems to me that everything I want is in Seattle.

It should be noted that I love my Toyota Prius, and Randy adores his Scion xA...

It was a State Farm coffee mug, which was an awesome prize.
It was a beautiful get-together of common ideals in San Francisco's beautiful setting..
It was a clear, crisp, sunny day today and from my viewpoint ten miles west I had a beautiful view of Boston ’ s skyline...
It was a great flick and really made me miss Boston.
It was a nice trip away from home and I LOVE San Francisco.
It was a real plus that he chose not to hire well known actors so we could believe we were seeing real people and not go " man, Tom Cruise sucks in this movie.
It was a really gay flight and American Airlines is really crappy, and has really crappy food.
It was a song he had on a CD from his older brother, a song we relished with much hilarity, usually driving around in Jeff's shitty Toyota.
It was a very enjoyable trip and I totally fell in love with the city-Boston is beautiful this time of year.
It was ace, and Tom Cruise is fucking beautiful, but I don't have a clue what it was all about!
It was awesome and driving my Honda sucks now....
It was easier to believe in Doris Day  s virginity than to endorse the idea that gorgeous Angelina Jolie is having a terrible time finding love(
It was good times.-how I miss Purdue!!
It was gorgeous, it was amazing, and I'm finally appreciating London too.
It was hilarious -- especially since I hate Tom Cruise so much!
It was just like those stupid Allstate commercials, where people are driving along just like normal, and then BAM they smack into another car!!..
It was really ironic that he spent the first part of class talking about his own professor at Harvard who was a pompous arrogant ass.
It's " Dallas Mavericks Suck, Volume 1 ", featuring DJ Kizzer, Slick Bandit, and an extremely depressed Sheridan D.!
It's a bit clumsily put, but I certainly appreciate Hillary Clinton's strongly-worded condemnation of voucher programs.
It's a good thing I don't care about sports: Seattle sucks at all of them.
It's a little green hyundai Accent which was perfect for her but she was 5'0 even I'm 5'5 and big legged and big footed.
It's about the MacBook Pro, which is awesome and I want one, but I have my beloved iBook, and believe you me, I love it..
It's actually quite entertaining to be sitting on our couch each week! ( If you watched, I HATE, HATE, HATE the Paris Hilton " wannabe " from Houston.
It's all good, I'm happy with my little Hyundai for now...
It's also amazing how much I hate Paris Hilton for being brainless and plastic but love Pansi for those same qualities....
It's also the kind of day where I don't care that my hair's messed up, or that I'm wearing a crappy Chicago Bulls shirt that's too big for me.
It's an amazing opportunity at State Farm w / amazing benefits!!!!
It's at the mad hatter and should be awesome, aaa always puts on an awesome show and I really like crime in stereo's new cd so hopefully they are good.
It's been 2 weeks and I miss Boston and you all like crazy...
It's been 4 weeks since I've bought my Yaris and all I can say is that I truly despise Toyota.
It's been said that if you're tired of New York ( or in some versions London ) you're tired of life;
It's between Tacoma and Seattle, which is pretty good especially if you like to go to either place..
It's coming back to Boston that sucks.
It's fun to drive and has about 110,000 less miles than the Honda did and is in good shape.
It's gotten so bad that I'm starting to miss Paris Hilton stories..
It's great, and we got to drive a Toyota Camry Hybrid around, which was awesome.
It's in London right outside oxford Circus tube station which I am over the moon about ( I love London! ) but I'm also thinking like...
It's not ideal-a nice tenure-track job would have been better-but I like UIUC and it's nice to know I'll have income and benefits and things for another year...
It's not like we want to see the Dallas Mavericks that close up anyway.
It's not so much that I'm tired of London, as that I've realised how tiring London can be.
It's not that I hate UCLA...
It's not that I'm a bad host, it's just that Purdue is really boring to visit.....
It's one of the reasons that Paris Hilton is so awesome: as she isn't pretty, has no talent, and is really kind of an awful person.
It's so sad, I used to LOVE Tom Cruise.
It's supposedly a 12 hour drive to Seattle which completely sucks!
It's the allstate piece this year, and as much as I despise allstate, I'm trying out anyway.
It's time to purchase a new computer, and it's going to be a MacBook Pro ( as I despise the keyboard design and the integrated Intel graphics on the MacBook ).
It's too bad that American Express is being greedy about it, and wants to make more profit on it than on the average credit card...
It's very possible that I also need a Volkswagen bus...
Its a satire of this whole stupid Harvard thing that I think so hysterical.
Its making me hate San Francisco and miss New York.
Its no wonder the New York Knicks suck at basketball every year.
Its not unusual that a Harvard grad sucks with girls and the Cable guy does very well in this department.
Jack London is very good at putting into words, what it feels like to be alive, and to feel that vitality, that knowledge, that connection to everything that lives.
Jacob Weisberg's obnoxious Slate article about Hillary Clinton's iPod selections purports to demonstrate that her song choices prove she's a phony.
Japan edged by US in San Francisco friendly..
Jennifer Aniston is awesome, Angelina Jolie is dumb.....
Jerry Falwell implied that Hillary Clinton is more powerful and evil than Lucifer...

Just for the Record I HATE SEATTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..
Just hire an obnoxious sophomore at MIT and ask him to run the company.
Just leave, and take shelter in your shitty 1993 Toyota.
Just like I hate Capital one and Compass bank, I now hate The Hartford.(
Just like Tom Cruise and his obnoxious insults of Brooke Shields'battle with depression...
Just like in Shanghai, the hotel I stayed in was super great because it had greens all over and it's peaceful for times when you need to cry or just simply be alone...
Just like when i prefer Edwin's Honda Jazz to mine despite the slight difference.

Knew nothing fancy was going to happen but I love Purdue football.
Komm mit is just so dumb.
Kurt Anderson of New York magazine has an excellent piece about why Hillary Clinton has little shot of simply being anointed the next President of the United States.

Many of you probably know that I despise Tom Cruise for his various moronic comments, but I also just hate Tom Cruise in general.
Many teacher   in UCLA sucks too.
MasterCard has been great, but I'm tired and I don't want to be there anymore.
MasterCard is really really good.
MasterCard sure came up with a clever advertising campaign.
Mastercard Commercials-Priceless I enjoy the series of MasterCard Commercials very, very much.
Mastercard comercials suck for many many reasons, but I have concentrated on three.
Matt's Macbook rocks -..
May I just say that I despise American Express???????????..
May my beloved 4-year-old HP Pavilion laptop rest in peace...
Maybe Hillary Clinton is boring and i should stop reading her'History ':
Maybe I need a Volkswagen.
Maybe I should be adopting orphans and doing volunteer work in Africa like Angelina Jolie.
Maybe I'll be working by the time next year rolls around, in which case I'll hopefully trade beloved macbook in for a'book pro, get office'07, and rock hard.
Maybe I'm just searching for funny shit, but I LOVE the Capital One credit card commercials that've been on lately!
Maybe chill at a cafe, with my macbook, and look cool,.
Maybe that's why I love Angelina Jolie...
Me and the San Francisco stink-ape could have come out there, it is literally less than an hour from my house.

More reasons why I really hate seattle is becuase people are just so fake.......
More specifically, my blue green Honda Civic sucks...
Most Geico ads star a pale guy with a dry and boring personality matched with an animated Gecko and a great script.
Most hate Seattle anyway.
Most of them involve one of my beloved Boston-area teams;
Most of this is related to the fact that what I'm doing here in London is good, but it isn't convincing me it's what I should be doing with my life.
Mostly because I had gotten to a point where all I was able to see was how much I truly hate Seattle, and living where I am.
Mostly, I hate US Airways...
Moving here almost five years ago was mostly because I wanted to meet and intern for Hillary Clinton.
Moving to Boston was difficult.

My car, that stupid fucking Honda, has decided it no longer liked its current fuel pump, leading me to sit here this afternoon before work awaiting the mechanic's work at transplanting a new one.
My choice, however, is a surprising one for me, given how happy I was at the indie revolution: I really wanted Tom Cruise to win for Jerry Maguire.
My class on thursday was cancelled, so alex till and I went on a spur of the moment trip to Purdue, which rocked!

My new job is going pretty good, I like it alot better than being at Citi, that was a crap job.
My old Dell Inspiron is a good computer but it's so old.
My other accident was because some dumb bitch in a tiny honda somerother decided that the red light she was at was taking too long and decided to go through it just as I was going through my green.
My other crappy Honda broke down and the engine sucks, or something.
My other problem I would like to voice is mainly that Harvard Sucks.
My previous IBM ThinkPad were great workhorses as well, but I am totally wireless now: D..
My sexy new MacBook Pro had arrived, yay.
My step-dad, Dave, is a big fan of the incredibly witty singing comedian from Harvard.
My stupid mastercard company is screwing me(
My trip to Seattle was amazing.
My upbringing suggests " used " but the Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris are looking pretty exciting or as David would say " Hot " or " Fetch.

Narrowing it down to the best black jack mit team web sites is sometimes unbelievably difficult.
Narrowing your choices down to the best aaa travel scholarship sites to visit can be unbelievably difficult.
Narrowing your choices down to the best london travel card sites to visit can be unbelievably difficult.
Nathan said that Shanghai River's SLB totally sucked, but that something else(
Naturally I love MIT and feel only vague acceptance toward either UM...
Navigating Harvard or Yale Universities should bring prestige and respect to those earning degrees from these Institutions.....
Need me a MacBook.
Needed AAA..
Needless to say, I wrote an extremely angry letter to American Airlines, not like they care.
Netty popped a tire and I had to wait for AAA in a sketchy apartment complex parking lot for a very long time in the twilight.
Nevertheless, I never go on dates, so would much prefer the table-side service I received in London --- namely, a back massage..
New MacBook = AWESOME!!!!!!!..
New York is too damn expensive and I hate Boston....
News that Angelina Jolie is going to be playing some sort of evil queen in the latest Beowulf movie > _ < What evil queen!?!?!

Nice Geo Metro for 2k but stickshift, didn't feel comfortable driving it and a pretty crappy toyota for 3k.
No complaints there either, cuz I love to teach math, I love logic, and I love UCLA...
No era tan horrible como en el Thinkpad pero es recomendable mantener pocas aplicaciones abiertas para que el disco no sufra demasiado..
No fucking joke I hate UCLA and that bullshit, Gonzaga was in my top two..
No job for Lea unfortunately means no trip to San Francisco, which really does suck.
No matter how beautiful UCLA is, it's still filled with a bunch of dead men walking.
No matter what, there are new meanings that I learned from the good old lesson of friendship, exactly like what a MasterCard commercial would say:
No more crappy ghetto Toyota-sans-AC for me!
No offence Ryan but Boston sucks ass.
No that's because Toyota sucked your dick, probably with a cash payout.
No, I love Tom Cruise because he is everything that you and I both strive to be and have.
No, San Francisco looks pretty fun, especially in that lovely gloomy weather.
No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life;
No, but I love Kraftwerk, Porsche, Audi, Volkswagen, Wim Wenders, Fritz Lang, Hermann Hesse, and the Scorpions!.
No, we didn't go to the moon, but London was good, and I remember shaking your hand before we kicked off the parade there.
Noplace anywhere near L. A. is going to give you the green grass you crave, and San Francisco sucks(
Nor is the editor of our lovely Exponent who stated in his editorial last week that Purdue is doing a good job paying attention to the architectural difficulties of our campus and is thus " aware.
Normally we both hate to drive around San Francisco but it seemed a lot easier to manage yesterday than during our previous trips.
Normally, it's only about once a year that I realize that Shanghai air sucks, but this time, I'll be realizing it every day for the rest of this year...
Normally, we probably would've missed our plane because of this alone, but the fat woman was good at feeling people up, and US Airways sucks...
North Fork Bank ( Because they're owned by CapitalOne and Capital one sucks. ).
Northwest Airlines and the horrible trip home.
Northwest Airlines is starting to suck:.
Northwest Airlines officially sucks.
Northwest Airlines still sucks..
Northwest Airlines sucks balls...
Northwest Airlines sucks!
Northwest Airlines sucks!.
Northwest airlines sucks..
Not London though-I hated London.
Not as much as I love God, and in a different way from how I love Hakeem Olajuwon and the Houston Rockets of the 1990s, but still, when it comes to Hakeem, I would not marry;
Not because I dislike Harvard, just because I need to know someone who wears academic robes and smokes a pipe.).(
Not because I sell Ford products or because I dislike Toyota products.
Not in Chicago though, Deng is considered one of the brightest young players in the NBA and will form part an exciting Chicago Bulls squad that has high hopes for the new season...
Not only are we ghetto girls but we both LOVE the Lakers.
Not only because of what I did or that I could not go back, but also because of their dreams for me to graduate from a great school like Purdue.
Not only does " MacBook " have a stupid ring to it, but it only comes in one size and is way too expensive...
Not spring in Seattle, no. I hate spring in Seattle.
Note to everyone, Toyota pretty much sucks anymore.
November in London is truly beautiful..
Now I LOVE London, but both cities were just such a cool scene..
Now I Really Dislike Tom Cruise...
Now I can totally rub it in my dad's face that Seattle sucks more than Pittsburgh does.
Now I hate Purdue Even More..
Now I like AAA very much!!
Now I miss Seattle more...
Now I really hate Angelina Jolie.
Now I remember how much I hate the Lakers...
Now I remember why I hate Southwest airlines.
Now I thought Xiang Yang in Shanghai was good this place is spectacular!
Now I'm sorry if I sound all paranoid, I like Hillary Clinton, really.
Now I'm walking around looking like the ugliest person in the world angelina jolie!!!!!!!
Now MIT seems boring in comparison.
Now all I need to do is make a phonecall to Mastercard, get my automatic-wossit set up, and TADAH...
Now anyone that knows me knows I hate Tom Cruise.
Now back to gloomy London, back to reality lu ~ ~ ~..
Now that I hate Tom Cruise, the film has a whole new resonance.
Now that I have a brand new laptop because Ryan bought me a beautiful Sony VAIO a couple of days ago for my future 21st b-day and Chrismakah present.
Now we have this stupid old toyota that takes too long to heat up.
Now, I happen to like Paris Hilton.
Now, I hate Tom Cruise and much as the next guy, but at times like this I can understand his wish to jump on a couch screaming about his infatuation.
Now, I love Shanghai, and I loved living there...
Now, I miss my long Angelina Jolie styled hair.
Now, I'm not saying that doing missions in Shanghai, Paris, London, Berlin, Rome, New York, etc. is useless.
Now, don  t get me wrong  I love US Airways.
Now, he's done an American Express advert, which is just brilliant, whatever you might think of American Express ads.
Now, my mind had shifted and I wanted the Volkswagen again.
Now, you have to understand, driving a manual transmission Toyota I laugh at the stupid fools that drive automatic SUVs as they pay $ 100 for a tank of gas while I zoom away at $ 35(
Number one: Paris Hilton thinking her album is good..
O RIGHT I HATE BOSTON....
OBSCENE-George W Bush in hotpants..

OHMANJMANJMANJMANJMANJMNAJNDYUFSGDFG I love those Volkswagen commercials....
OK WELL THE NBA CHAMPIONSHIP WAS JUST ON AND I WANTED THE DALLAS MAVERICKS TO WIN BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THE HEAT HAVE TO TAKE AWAY THIER DIGniTY!!!!!!
OK, I used to love Tom Cruise, I thought he was sexy.
OK, so I had some extra cash, and / or needed a deduction, and my none too reliable Sony Vaio finally bit the dust with a motherboard glitch that crashed the computer anytime I physically moved it.
OMFG HONDA SUCKS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FORD A < > L < > L < > THE WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.
OMG i love Harvard Sq!!!!!
Obama, Hillary Clinton, Biden, and Bayh are worthless as presidential candidates if you want to split the religious right and win a close election.
Obviously, San Francisco is lousy with taquerias, and given the broad mass appeal of burritos here, creating a complete information source for our fair cityâ   s burrito shops seemed like the right thing to do.
Obviously, since UCLA sucks BALLS...
Of course David L. the slacker will be at some crappy MIT, or Harvard or whatever crappy school...
Of course my mom loves purdue but she was set on me going there before I even saw it.
Of course, the MacBook is totally useless with only that 512mb of ram(
Off to work now, where I will drive an even crappier Toyota Tercel.
Often I would find myself on a great site like 160gb serial ata hard drive w 8mb and bookmark it as a great resource.
Often I would find myself on a great site like allstate 250 motorcycle andnot insurance and bookmark it as a great resource.
Often I would find myself on a great site like citi trust finance company and bookmark it as a great resource.

Ohio State Farm Home Insurance And Water Damage, C. Yesterday, I thought I really found a great site about ohio state farm home insurance and water damage, but that was just the teaser.
Ok so allstate bla bla bla Allstate was boring but also a lot of fun.
Ok, I can admit that I hate Tom Cruise...
Ok, I know I must be completely nuts, but I love the new Paris Hilton song, " Nothing in this World "!
Ok, I'm gonna be honest, Lakers suck, the only reason they're this far is because of their size advantage, and Suns are a bad defensive team.
Ok, all lying aside, this website is an awesome website put on by MIT that has course notes and quizzes and such for a sizeable portion of their classes from the last couple years.
Ok, fine, I hate Seattle.
Ok, so in case you didn ’ t get the memo-I LOVE UCLA!
Ok, so the stupid American Airlines lost my luggage and I didn't get it back till this afternoon when most of the trip was over.
Ok, so we got to the Hotel Hyundai, which is pretty amazing.
Ok-I make it very clear that I hate UCLA.
Okay so even though London is especially sexy and gloomy and filled with bad teeth, im considering only a year abroad during my sophmore year at the Brooks institute in Santa Barbra.
Okay, I already hate Honda after the misfortune of owning a 2001 Civic and I think all their new vehicles are hideous, especially the Ridgeline and the Element aka the vehicle that Lego built.
Okay, just kidding, I love the Indian food in London, but I have yet to find any good Mexican, so I am ready to be enlightened.
Okay, really, I used to love Tom Cruise.
Okay, strip clubs in Boston, SUCK!
Old Volkswagen Beetles are great for selfportraits; )......
On Monday, while perusing through the Craigslist ads for Motorcycles, I came across an ad for an'89 Honda Hawk which looked really good in the pics that were included in the ad.
On October 15th I went to Indiana to see Jerry play football for Purdue, that was such an awesome day!!!
On a lighter note, I love my macbook.
On a side note, UCLA still sucks...
On an unrelated note, I strongly dislike Hillary Clinton and the idea of her being the next president, which I would bet money is going to happen...
On another note, I completely detest the GEICO cavemen commercials.
On another note, I fucking hate San Francisco.
On monday, my poor crappy white toyota was finally donated away..
On the boat ride, we saw the beautiful skyline of Boston.
On the bright side, Geico Insurance KICKS ASS!!!!!!
On the invite of the former Iranian president to Harvard, Netanyahu notes that this, too, was wrong.
On the other hand American Express has been absolutely horrible to me.
On the other hand, i also love Honda ( cars ) cuz my baby is still clucking after all these years.
On the upside, apparently Toyota Siennas are good at taking hits to the driver's side door.
On the way home from work one night, the radio announcer mentioned it was the peak night of the Perseid meteor showers and the local Seattle forecast was conducive to a great viewing.
On this front London is fantastic!
On three previous trips, AAA was useless when it came to finding pet friendly lodging so I didn't bother this time around....
On top of that, the coolant reservoir cap for Honda CRV sucks ass.
Once again I am frustrated with State Farm.
Once again I thought about Rudy!!! ( My old car ) I want another Honda Civic cause this truck is gettin on my last nerve already.
Once again I'm slighted by the evil secretaries of UIUC.
Once again United Airlines + SFO = Evil.
Once again a very Happy Birthday in the beautiful San Francisco!
Once in last winter, I hated CTE Shanghai.
Once there was a rather trumped up play in London that was absolutely terrible to watch.
One half of her room is chargers one half is lakers that's awesome.
One horrible performance versus Seattle and he bounces back against Arizona, another horrible performance against Miami and a record setting performance against those Giants!
One of China's richest men and a senior Shanghai municipal official are under investigation for their parts in an alleged improper loan involving 3.2 billion yuan ( US $ 400 million ) in city funds...
One of London's most respected and loved theatres.
One of the cleverest demonstrations of this effect was a study published last year in Harvard ’ s Quarterly Journal of Economics.
One of the things I love about Seattle is real honest-to-god fall color....
One of them is an unbelievably great position at American Express, doing bond analysis.
One of them is going to be called Toyota, because Toyotas are hardy, and I want my fish to last, like a Toyota.
One postive I did forget to say, is that when I worked for Superior, they weren't as anal about goals and keeping shareholders happy like Allstate.
One thing is for sure: San Francisco itself is amazing and didn't disappoint in the slightest.
Only other thing � stupid American Airlines lost my suitcase somewhere between LAX and SFO.
Only real option was Perkins, so we headed there, and I drove my Mom's Hyundai Tucson which was GREAT.
Only stupid Hyundai connects, don't ask why either.
Only the " how paint is applied to VW Volkswagen " was interesting.
Opponent calls Hillary Clinton Ugly..
Oppose Hillary Clinton and all evil doing evil doers everywhere!!!

She accepted a job up in Seattle ( which is going to suck to commute ) teaching 7th & 8th grade science and math.
She also said she didnt miss her Thanksgiving because Geico was so great and he goes " MASHED POTATOES AND CRANBERRY SAUCE!!!!
She chopped off all of her hair, dyed it jet black and got a horrible pair of Honda Civic-sized fake boobs.
She dresses way fierce and lives in Shanghai, so no wonder London is boring!
She is currently considering a Toyota Yaris, which is a little economy model with fantastic gas mileage ( 35-40 ) and only costs $ 11,000 for a 2007 model.
She lives in london which sucks but we are still planning the day we meet Lol..
She said she had been having a lot of trouble with American Express.
She strikes me like Hillary Clinton-lite.
She wants Sheppard so she can make pretty babies with his handsome ATA filled genes.
She would be an unattractive woman if she were white, and Hillary Clinton would probably be an attractive woman if she were black.
She'll leave thinking she did us a favor with her bogus AAA rate.
She's still going to get wedgied once we wait for her skin to stop sagging...-I think that the kid that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt is going to be one ugly kid.
She's super excited about Purdue which is awesome.
Short of perfect, but far from being terrible, San Francisco was a lot of fun.
Sigh, I miss London...
Simple as that As a Lib, I'm happy with the Honda, it's good on the gas, and rarely have any problems.
Since I'm quite sure you are all dying to know this, I shall state how much I fucking loathe Harvard Square..
Since the Camry has been so great over the years I want another Toyota.
Since the economics of my life now depend on contract work, I need a laptop and what I really want is a Dual core Thinkpad T60 but IBM only finances to business and not the private consumers.
Since then I've found that Thinkpad has a horrible dead pixel policy, generally 8-15 to warrent a repair where Fujitsu's requirement is just 3.
Since then, 25 automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have recalled about 370,000 defective vehicles, according to the agency.
So Angelina Jolie and her humanitarian crusades can suck it when Ronald McDonald, Grimace, Big Boy and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man are roaming the world terrorizing folks and force-feeding them junk food...
So Boston is still awesome.
So Brad congrats you made the I hate Hillary Clinton List.
So Harvard was totally awesome;
So I LOVE these Volkswagen commercials!
So I don't understand why ppl are saying that Shanghai is so good, so advanced, etc etc...
So I get my news through many filters but bottom line: Angelina Jolie is amazing...
So I guess I still love UCLA.
So I made an angry call to the Toyota place and explained that they were going to make us miss the plane ( or blow us to bits ).
So I need a Mastercard for everything else.
So I need to go online to the American Airlines site(
So I officially love Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie..
So I stopped at an American Airlines counter, and talked to some of the most friendly airline folks I've ever talked to.
So I told him I was hungry, and I made him drive me to Taco Bell in his little shitty Toyota truck.
So I was like, " I WANT MY MACBOOK BACK!
So I went round London with feckin AWFUL hair.
So I went to the American Airlines counter to get my boarding passes home and encountered the completely useless security questionairre...
So I would recommend Seattle, to others, you know, becuase we can still be friends.
So I'm going downstairs to have Yet Another delicious Seattle Sutton Healthy Eating lunch...
So I'm going to be getting a MacBook, which is exciting because I've always wanted a Mac.
So I'm on hold and have been for 25 minutes while they sort this out and for the record, I hate Geico.
So Turd drives a fucking ugly Hyundai Getz.
So a girl might say, " I love Tom Cruise!
So after 2 replacements and 1 logic board and top case repair I have grown very tired of my MacBook's constant processor whine...
So after spending a little over a week back in UCLA, I can definately say that so far, life is hella more exciting than last year and if this continues my summer hopes will be fulfilled.
So all I can say is I'll take Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco Values over a hypocritical adulterer like Gingrich any day of the week...
So another disappointing San Francisco Giants season has come to an end.
So apart from stupid American Airlines, a minor cold(
So apparently, letting Helena drive your BRAND NEW Honda is a stupid idea.
So basically, we can identify who is a complete cocksucking hooplehead ( I won't let Deadwood go! ) by identifying people who actually think Paris Hilton is a cool kitty...
So boston sucked, pretty much.
So clever and I prefer MasterCard over others, anyway.
So does my shitty honda.
So far, Allstate has been great....
So far, I like Allstate!
So for now, I can't sign the waivers, Allstate is acting as awful as ever, and we wait some more...
So i am happy here and when i am home i miss boston so much.
So i hate american express cards....
So i really hate Angelina Jolie thats not news..
So i went out and bought a couple of sweaters and dress pants and such, i also bought some sexy underwear because it just struck me as simply hilarious that State Farm Insurance has to pay for my sexy underwear.
So if $ 1 = 1 point as it currently is on my Sears MasterCard, that's like $ 5000 GODDAMN DOLLARS for a stupid old $ 50 gift cert or something from HMV.
So if anyone has any suggestions on how to make Seattle suck less that doesn't involve price gouging, please let me know: )..
So if anyone out there wants a gorgeous zippy little red Honda Civic that's a cool retro 1989 model do let me know!
So in essence, the Honda commercial is a clever play on that TZ episode.
So is school, although I HATE Purdue.
So it seemed like he would speed up and down the stupid San Francisco hills.
So it seems that the Mayor of Boston Was right and the census was wrong: gion / breaking_news / 2006 / 10 / the_mayor_was _ r. html Boston Grew, not shrank, population.
So like I want a MacBook Pro and it comes out to about $ 1995 with my college discount.
So mom gets the free ipod nano and I get to trade in my worthless dell for a shiny new macbook.
So my Shanghai card is useless.
So my new hp pavilion laptop is amazing.
So now I hate AAA..
So now i'm the obnoxious AAA clerk and the host.
So small and so taking 4 AAA batteries and sucking them down, but so awesome anyways..
So stupid Citi keeps calling my phone.
So that means that Harvard student who scored perfect in his SAT may be an English idiot.
So the decision is that I hate US Airways and won't ever fly on there again.
So the lessons learned here are that US Airways sucks.
So there we are, we love ATA....
So therefore i am really enjoying watchin the Dallas Mavericks RIP some ass these days.
So this Honda dealership sucks balls.
So we call AAA and of course god sends us a little beautiful creation of his own we call Elroy.
So we went back to the same hotel we'd stayed at the night before in San Francisco which sucked because I was having a really nice time with Scott...
So what do you think of Tom Cruise-hes stupid..
So when buying a car, buy from a good dealership and I would recommend avoiding Volkswagen at all costs, because if you ever have a problem, their Customer Care...
So when the super rude American Airlines lady told us that they had overbooked our flight, I was ready to commit a homicide..
So while Tata and Hyundai can go suck their thumbs, it is Maruti which is laughing all the way to the bank.
So yeah if you think im lame i dont care cuz im ( wo ) man enough to admit that I love Paris hilton!
So yeah, Purdue has a terrible smell...
So yeah, Purdue was awesome.
So yeah, got here late last night, American Airlines sucks.
So, Boston sucked but as soon as I was in the car with Ike and it was all behind me, I felt instantly better...
So, Hyundai had to send Rob the wrong part.
So, I still pretty much hate Boston...
So, I think what I'm getting at is that I will miss Boston.
So, I'm cruising the Hunky Fest and drinking beer with mi madre when I hit upon an amazing idea for a MasterCard commercial: " Hungarian Hotdogs-$ 5.
So, Northwest Airlines suck!!!
So, after that, we headed home, ate dinner, watched a crappy Tom Cruise movie and went to bed..
So, all I want for Christmas is my dignity, like I said above, and like the Capital One add said before me.
So, for the 3 of you that have been craving some profanity-laden, semi-cogent rants about how George W Bush is the suck, you should only have to suffer a few more days....
So, if any of you happen to catch it, think of me and how much I hate Paris Hilton..
So, like, apparently Paris Hilton really is as stupid as she looks!
So, the specs of the Lenovo IBM ThinkPad T 60 p are pretty impressive, memory aside, just as you would expect in a mobile workstation.

There is a lot of anti UCLA and Stanford sentiments at Berkeley, on one shirt it said, UCLA sucks, and Stanford swallows.
There is many other things I can think of that I can use MasterCard for than a stupid electric bill!!!!!..
There was a pumpkin covered with beautiful rose designs, and a Seattle skyline that was beautiful.
There was a time that I hated Boston but, now I think I start appreciating'BOSTONESS ", maybe getting used to East Coast...
There was a time, back when the roads were merely clogged, that I used to love to get behind the wheel of my old 1966 Volkswagen bug and just hit the road.
There were seriously points in the night when -- realizing that I was powerless to stop the noise -- I wanted to beat the black Hyundai Santa Fe into submission with my Mag Light or at least key it.

There will be an angry call to AAA this Monday...
There's a lot of " OMFG I HATE HILLARY CLINTON SOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!
There's a question I want to raise about somebody like Hillary Clinton.
There's absolutely no place on earth like the Bay Area and I will always miss it, no matter how much I like Seattle.
There's also the, " I LOVE Angelina Jolie, but absolutely adore Jennifer Aniston's closet.
There's an awesome picture of Tom Cruise there.
There's only two real options that I see: a big city, like NYC or San Francisco, or out of country: England, Germany, Switzerland, maybe even Sweden or Holland...
Therefore, it is concluded that Ashley is one big fat gay lesbian who thinks that Hillary Clinton is handsome...
These Honda Civic units would be those that are fuel efficient.
These people are stupid that car isn't just cool because it's a cute car oh no. A volkswagen is a beautiful car no matter what one it is.

They had closed the door already, but American Airlines is pretty good on communications, I guess, because they were waiting for me...
They had offered him a ticket out of Boston, but that was stupid so she found him a ticket from MHT to Cincinnatti to Atlanta ( where he would catch the Army chartered flight ).
They have ppl over every now and then, and they are the ghetto ppl that drive all those ugly looking annoying Honda � bumblebee � civics, you know what i mean, the trouble ones.
They never talk down to you or make you feel bad that you might struggle with the Toyota Way in your own environment, because you are not Toyota...
They quote a former Harvard student " They ( men ) would always be very obnoxious to the girls.
They remind me of everyone I hated at Harvard.
They say the dumbest things AND i hate their SHANGHAI accent...
They then decide to wage war from the top of my crappy Toyota..........
They won a thriller in overtime last night over the " boring " San Antonio Spurs.

This MIT Sketching video is really pretty damn cool..
This beautiful San Francisco like weather...
This is [ I love LONDON ].
This is a big spread, but San Francisco was truly awful last year and they didn't make any moves in the offseason that would lead you to believe that they have gotten any better.
This is a view of the famous Royce Hall in UCLA, as well as the beautiful Shapiro Fountain.

Though I would really love to own a Volkswagen Beetle, a Siberian Husky and an incredible home threatre system(
Though UCLA is beautiful campus, they don't have my intended major which is Business Management.

To The Young Attractive Ladies Who Were Thinking Of Moving To Seattle:..
To all those Purdue fans suck on that.
To be fair, as the Access and Inclusion Co-ordinator at a shitty south London school, he probably is the best thing to happen to a couple of these kids;

Well, first thing to do before blogging about my trip to Shanghai is this dumb little meme:..
Well, i hate london but the department isn't AS bad but hey, that can change by next week!!..
Well, it's because I love the New York Knicks.
Well, many Democrats did make futile gestures, futile speeches even, even crappy Hillary Clinton.

Wellesley / Boston are really gorgeous during the fall, but I must admit they have really freakish weather.
Went golfing today, and I saw this on an ancient crappy toyota pickup....
Went shopping at H & M ( I hate the one in Boston because there are soooooo many people in that store alllll the time. ).
Went to Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit at the Seattle Science Center which was AWESOME.
Went to a really good vegetarian cafe, went to the london graphics centre Which would be a fantastic place to work.
Went to the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Hall yesterday, which may sound boring, but it was actually pretty cool.
What I like about Paris Hilton ( hell, the only thing I like about her ) is that she's the first to admit that she's an ignorant whore.
What I love about being a student at MIT is the well-rounded learning experience:
What I love the best about Geico is their roadside assistance.
What I really hate Toyota's automatic gearbox is that it tries to stay at the highest possible gear, except when the engine is about to stall, THEN it would step down a gear.
What I will miss is Toyota Turkey.
What I'm saying is I want the Dallas Mavericks to win the NBA Finals this year.
What can I say besides Purdue looked horrendous on both sides of the ball.
What do you think of Angelina Jolie being pregnant?-i love angelina jolie...
What i love about my own citi checking is that they give me 5 fee-free non-citibank ATM transactions per month-and they reimburse the other banks fee as well!.
What made this one different was that the dumb US Airways website was down the night before, so we couldn ’ t print out our boarding passes.
What started out as a routine flight for American Airlines Flight 1874 turned out to be an exciting ending for more than 120 passengers and air crew at Newark Liberty International Airport...
What's more the cd drive on my ThinkPad sucks so that won't really work..
What's my favorite TV show: Jeopardy, but I also really like Boston Legal and DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES..
What's ridiculous is the press and people who go " Okay Tom Cruise is an idiot.
Whatever it is, London stinks of number 1's today...
When Emmy was in town, I told her ( in a moment of pure physical pain as we hiked up to the Lombard / Leavenworth intersection ) that San Francisco is always halfway between fantastic and miserable.

When I contacted the airline-Northwest Airlines-I was blessed to speak with the sweetest, most genuine man in the world-Vincent.
When I saw the letter that said 19,000 people applied, I no longer feel so crappy about the Harvard thing.
When I say taunt, I mean he walks buy and chants " let's go hoosiers " or says damnit I hate Purdue.
When Purdue went up by one, followed by a beautiful td pass by Gopher qb Cupito...
When Stone was asked for suggestions for the additional scenes she said, " I think Hillary Clinton is fantastic.

When it eventually does turn on, it says that the MacBook was turned off wrong, restarted incorrectly.
When the Yankees play the Red Sox, I have to pull for the Bronx Bombers � that � s how much I despise Boston � but then I pray for the Yankee � s plane to go down.
When u saw the Effiel Tower,   you will know that Shanghai Oriental TV Towel sucks, so   does any other Big towel.
When we were in the parking lot after the movie, a car suddenly stopped by and a lady shouted " UCLA SUCKS "!!!!!
Whereas even at Narita, being lined up by incompetent Northwest Airlines staff a family of Shanghainese tried to graft themselves surreptitiously onto a line stretching for many metres behind them.
Whether she gave this poor guy $ 1 or $ 1,000, all the positive PR in the world can't change the fact that Paris Hilton sucks and her album tanked..
Whether we liked Hillary Clinton, or not, many of us are getting understanding about the need for health care reform.
Which confused me, because I hate Boston and he hates driving in Boston.
Which is fine, since AAA is quite the dubious cottage industry of hype and hyperbole over blah bands...
Which is less than 1 / 2 of the price it was available for from apple.com/store before they pulled it off the site to make room for the evil abomination MacBook.
Which is really ashame because I really like shopping there but I detest the wackey hippies of San Francisco....
Which is to say: American Airlines is the shittiest flight service and I WARNED my mother not to book us on it.
Which just goes to show you, Tom Cruise is awesome.
Which makes me think I need AAA more than AA...
Which means I need a Thinkpad since i've managed to stick with a desktop machine for all these years.
Which reminds me of the funniest thing, when Eric suggested I belonged somewhere like Harvard.
Which reminds me, I need to get a citi credit card...
While I admire Hillary Clinton and would like at some point soon to see a woman as President, I feel she has " too much past baggage " as does ex-President William Clinton.

but MIT IS awesome and i love the people here and i'm having a lot of fun..
but NO. no one posted'cept cory saying somtine was up my butt how rude i just mit shut this site down so i don't have to deal with it...
but after watching you guys i had a once-in-a-lifetime " omg i love mit " moment.
but also links to your blogs, favorite articles, funny bits, important news, why Bush sucks, why Paris Hilton sucks, why Kylie is God, etc. Please include links when emailing.
but as much as i love london, malaysia is now my home..
but as usual team Honda punya strategist really suck big time lah..

but hasnt made it home yet cause stupid american airlines is fucking up!
but hate tom cruise more.
but here state-side, i think i love my honda more...
but honda is so stupid.
but honestly, I hate tom cruise and I don  t think he did a GREAT job..
but horrible in San Francisco(
but i LOVE my MacBook.
but i also love UCLA....
but i didn't = ) and MIT lunch breaks are awesome cuz we're just that cool.
but i dislike seattle because the public trans is bad and the traffic is worse.
but i do like the " Geico saved 15 % by switching to Chuck Norris " one..
but i do love my mit kids!..
but i found that layout and i RALLY liked it cuz i LOVE UCLA!!
but i hate angelina jolie now...

but i still miss my sony vaio.........
but i would recommend a sony vaio or a toshiba brand......
but i'd prefer london anytime.
but if ur mom is into honda..
but if you can think of anything else based in london that would be cool please let me know! % @!!!!!
but it was a fun run that we had, tobacco and i. kind of like my time in seattle, it just felt like the fun was over...
but it was just something I really wanted because I really love Purdue and I wanted to be able to find a way to show people how much I care.
but it would depend on how much i like uiuc and how the research is there...
but it's fine.. ( though i miss my sweet sick honda.. )..
but it's ok, i still love UCLA.
but ive been around the u. s.. seattle is unique and awesome and i loved it!.

but seriously, ucla really does suck.
but shanghai did luk beautiful in white though.
but still i recommend Sony Vaio worth it..
but stupid state farm won't give me a quote because we don't have insurance with them right now.
but that doesn't mean that i want a hyundai excel with a ferrari engine.
but that seems unlikely for me, although i love boston..
but that's because the off-campus housing scene at Purdue is so shitty)
but the Toyota Yaris is awesome'ist...
but the engine i like toyota....
but the fact that it's in Boston kind of kills it, because Boston basically sucks....
but the macbook looks so awesome.
but the night view of shanghai is really good.
but the only airline that goes on a direct flight to shanghai was horrible!
but the red line is like broken so both times i've had to take a shuttle from park street to kendall and then the t to harvard which sucks and made me late both times.
but then he completely ripped open my heart in the worst way possible, right before leaving for stupid purdue.
but they are biased. [ do you look like any celebrities ]: I've been told once I looked like Jennifer Gardner and once like Angelina Jolie...
but they kinda made it by default-houston never got healthy, and seattle sucked monkey ass...
but thursday AAA is going to the clinton library and to some other boring thing close to there!!

i would miss my time in citi....
i would rather prefer a Volkswagen Passat.
i wouldnt really recommend uk anymore i hate london.
i'd definitely prefer boston over baltimore.
i'd like to write about allstate.
i'd love to see the clips and lakers in the second round, though the winner would just be a stepping stone for the mavs or spurs...
i'll miss UIUC...
i'm beginning to hate san francisco.
i'm currently watching love at harvard on youtube(
i'm getting a little sick of seattle.
i'm happy that the lakers are looking pretty good.
i'm liking the geico commercials with little richard and burt bacharach being my favorite.
i'm looking forward to this weekend cause people are coming up and then of course saturday is boston, i love boston.
i'm not sure but i just have gut feelings that i will love UCLA and that it's a much better school.
i'm not sure which one is my favorite but i know i like the geico ones where the gecko talks.
i'm off to harvard square bitches..
i'm really REALLY considering a yellow volkswagen beetle ( 2.5 L or possibly even TDI ), but the problem is that i've been told that volkswagen is known to have horrible reliability.
i'm saying this without actually having seen it by daylight, but boston at night kicks ass.
i'm sick of my dumpy little hyundai accent.
i'm sick of the summit egos and the mit incompetence.
i'm sorry but i LOVE LOVE LOVE the geico caveman commercials.
i'm taking the " T ".. ( i hate boston drivers )..
i've been incredibly busy lately, but seattle is fucking awesome & i love it.
i've been saying i want a honda crv, but i went looking today after work and i really like the mitsubishi montera.
i've been to shows all over the country world, and there's just something about indigo girls in san francisco that is so amazing.
i've come to like the environment of UCLA and i miss it already.
i've decided i hate harvard..
i've decided i love purdue.
i've decided i really miss london.
i: III ¡ n ¡ ã * 3 * ¡ @ ¡ @ ¡ @ I LOVE TOM CRUISE....!!.....
ich glaub der anblick von bastian mit ner tasse tee is fast so absurd wie der name des autors..
ich komm mit den meisten mädels blöderweise auch net so gut zurecht-sin ma zu arrogant und tussi-haft....
if angelina jolie was a seriously evil bitch she'd still be hot..
if i finish law here at USF or at some other place, like Harvard.
if only stupid ucla and ucb sent me one.
if you did im soo jealous i love the lakers!
if you're going to render your pictures, then i highly recommend the macbook pro intel core 2 duo.
im going to give the tahoe to either my mom or sister then im getting a 2005 mustang GT and a little shitty volkswagen to go to school in....
im not much of an upstate person, but i hear boston college & b. u. are great = ].
im pretty sure its seattle that sucks because its always raining there.....
im so glad that allstate is already so awesome.
im soo happy because my grandparents are going to help me pay for my summer class because purdue cal is stupid and i prolly wont get any help paying for them but thats another story!
in 2 weeks, i will be in seoul with my mom, using my sexy new macbook!.
in San Francisco, that's a stupid plan, my-nurse-only-lets-me-use-a-spoon.
in San Juan because American Airlines sucks.
in Seattle sucks.
in boston, " spring " is actually a terrible description for the season following the vernal equinox, because the word suggests an appearance of startling quickness.
in cococnut island toyota / bitch / ahjuma, fat hand slave etc barks at mi.....
in future, i would like to buy a Volkswagen Beetle Convertible...
in her Toyota Prius hybrid, which is just an awesome car that I totally want to get).
in late october, capital one put out their ad on teevee with that really catchy jingle " hands in my pocket hands in my pocket hands in my pockets "..
in my family ( much thanks to my mother's side ), i escaped this fate, and was instead taught to love purdue.
in my opinion, shanghai really sucks...
in other news, mun needs to come back from singapore because i like that new paris hilton song.
in other news, this Wes Anderson american express commercial is awesome...
in simple words, in seattle Bank of America is FAMOUS to be a crappy bank n all the locals dont use them.
in stupid polluted shanghai..
in the dreams, someone kept proposing to me with a fantastic purple fake glass diamond ring in san francisco chinatown, only the slopes never ends and i kept saying'yes!

in the thing that ses i love sk8ter boys u mit..
incidentally, i love my new macbook, especially this nifty little front row feature, that i have yet to find a real use for.
ini kayaknya ada something wrong ama program EE bachelor nya purdue.
instead let's talk about those amazing Houston Rockets.
interning at hillary clinton's is too tedious most of the time to make up for the brief glimpses of fulfillment that such an experience supposedly provides.
interviewed at Seattle Grip and Lighting earlier this week, looks good....
is how much I hate the San Francisco Unified right now.
is it me or does she a little like angelina jolie in the 2nd pic..
ist wohl der Richard Ehrenberger gemeint mit get rich bitch oder?..
it and also because I dislike Honda.
it has taken forever to figure out where I needed to go to do everything, and it turns out that half the things have to be done in London, which is just great.
it is Yale facebook time -- time to join the Harvard SUCKS and its 10,000 variations groups at Yale...
it is times like this where i realize i LOVE ucla so so much.
it made me miss seattle and my connection to my city, but it reminded me that i do have a home, somewhere that will always feel right.
it should be a good time even if mit sucks..
it turns out someone stole his computer while he was in London which really sucks.
it used to be my dad's. we switched lappies cos that stupid macbook giving me too much probs.
it was a lie, i love harvard..
it was a me and dad sorta thing..-i did love the chicago bulls too.
it was even better when this ghetto kid pulls up with rap music blaring in his crappy toyota.
it would be until tuesday BUT purdue is stupid....
it's a 6-legged mit larva that sucks the blood of vertebrates and causes intense iritation.
it's also the ncaa tournament final, but i loathe ucla and really don't care for florida either, so i kinda wrote that off).
it's amazing just how stupid hillary clinton is...
it's been only in the past couple of months and has been tied with days I hate Seattle.
it's funny, when i was much younger i used to hate london and always looked forward to going to vegas after london but it's so different now.
it's not that i don't like purdue, don't get me wrong i love purdue, i just love cincinnati way more.
it's not that i imbibe a lot, but i feel silly being like every other harvard kid going to these stupid events in belltowers and such.
it's not that i think hillary clinton would be a good president.
its cool I love the GEICO gecko too.
its not a'dream car'but i want a honda civic..
its not like we want a 2006 hyundai or something.
iv been good staying away from them (:.. < 3 i heard love story in harvard was good...
ive also learned that there may be troubles with the hyundai accent i helped mom and dad buy last year.
iwent to harvard for a drama tournament last week, and i came back w / a reaally awful cold, or sicknes or something.

site I found truly found gave excellent info about sony vaio user guide hands down.
so I HATE angelina jolie as it is right...

so i'm pretty positive i hate purdue cal like,...
so i'm sitting here at home after two weeks in la and now i have ucla / ucla friend withdrawal which sucks a lot.
so if anyone ever watches a boston celtics game on tv, the reason the announcers are complaining that boston sucks so bad is just because red made them that awesome back in the day..

so mit is evil.
so my beloved macbook died on me yesterday.

so so boring in shanghai.
so sometimes i hate san francisco, i hate that they close down the bridge to one lane, direct everyone off, and then evyone back on....
so that was upseting, then im driving home from work and this guy in this little honda civic looking piece of crap almost hits me, and then turns around and calls ME a stupid bitch..
so the only car they had was an ass orange chevy aveo ( like a toyota echo only uglier )..
so the only thing that good ole northwest airlines can do is book us on 3 different flights and give us some stupid food vouchers and some other nonsense.
so we had to call his mom and they came then we had to wait for the stupid AAA and that took like forever!
so when we were all little we probably wanted to go to places like harvard or stanford or yale or stuff like that.
so yeah we walked after them and then went to sit down and the last band we saw was cut short cause of the stupid San Francisco law.
so, I let it all out to Marci and realized that I really dislike San Francisco...
so, if anybody would like some cash for the use of their mastercard or american express I'll suck on your toes.
