Data downloaded from: https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/si650winter11/data
The training set contains tweets reviewing some movies. It looks as if tweets were written manually for studying purposes. It contains limited amount of titles and expressions.
There is also some amount of test data, which can be used to test our model. It contains only texts of tweets.
I randomly chose 1000 samples from dataset (500 negative and 500 positive).
